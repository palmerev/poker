# poker
This initially addressed the problem of taking in a poker hand of five cards and determining the type of hand. Other functions were later added to solve Project Euler problem 54: https://projecteuler.net/problem=54 (read_hands.py).

The poker directory contains the object-oriented implementation of a few classes relating to playing cards. Instances of class Card and class Hand are comparable using the built-in comparison operators. This means that the built-in sorted(), min(), and max() functions also behave as expected.

The end goal is to create a multi-player poker game.
